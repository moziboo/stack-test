# API Client Simplification Summary

## What Was Removed

### Dependencies
- `@tanstack/react-query` (^5.85.3)
- `@tanstack/react-query-devtools` (^5.85.3) 
- `zod` (^4.0.17)

### Files Deleted
- `src/schemas/index.ts` - Zod validation schemas
- `src/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` - TanStack Query provider

## What Was Simplified

### API Client (`src/api/apiClient.ts`)
**Before:** Complex validation with Zod schemas, separate validation function
**After:** Simple fetch-based client with basic TypeScript types

- Removed all Zod imports and validation logic
- Simplified to direct `fetch` API usage
- Moved from runtime validation to compile-time TypeScript types
- Kept the same API interface for easy transition

### API Hooks (`src/hooks/api.ts`)
**Before:** TanStack Query hooks with caching, background updates, etc.
**After:** Basic React state management with `useState` and `useEffect`

- Replaced `useQuery` with `useState` + `useEffect`
- Added manual loading and error state management
- Included basic debouncing for search (300ms)
- Maintained the same hook interface for compatibility

### Components Updated
- `src/examples/UsersExample.tsx` - Updated titles and descriptions
- `src/examples/ApiExamplesApp.tsx` - Removed provider wrapper, updated content

## What You Still Have

âœ… **TypeScript type safety** - Using basic interfaces instead of runtime validation
âœ… **Loading and error states** - Manual state management 
âœ… **API client functions** - Same interface, simpler implementation
âœ… **Custom hooks** - Same hook names and returns, different implementation
âœ… **Example components** - Still work the same way
âœ… **Search debouncing** - Basic setTimeout implementation

## Key Differences

| Feature | Before (TanStack + Zod) | After (Simplified) |
|---------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Validation | Runtime with Zod | Compile-time with TS |
| Caching | Automatic | None |
| Background Updates | Automatic | Manual |
| Request Deduplication | Automatic | None |
| Loading States | Built-in | Manual |
| Error Handling | Advanced retry logic | Basic try/catch |
| Bundle Size | Larger | Smaller |
| Learning Curve | Steeper | Gentler |

## Next Steps

Now you can:
1. Study the simplified code to understand the basics
2. Read TanStack Query and Zod documentation
3. Gradually add back features as you learn them
4. Ask for help implementing specific features you need

The simplified version gives you a solid foundation to build upon! ðŸš€
